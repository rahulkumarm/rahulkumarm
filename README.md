### 👋 Hi there! My name is Rahul

**🎓** I recently wrapped up my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder.

**📚** I possess extensive experience in machine learning, data science, and data visualization. My research primarily revolves around utilizing representation learning and transfer learning techniques to identify and ablate functionally specific neurons in deep learning models.
In my role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I successfully facilitated the learning of Statistics using R by delivering captivating lectures, assessing assignments, and providing consistent feedback to students. Additionally, I taught fundamental concepts of C++, crafted weekly assignments, and offered office hours for additional assistance.
During my tenure as a Data Science Intern at LiveRamp, I actively worked on data transformation, modeling using XGBoost and scikit-learn, and experimented on sample size and feature selection using BigQuery.

**🏔** In my free time you can find me exploring various subreddits or immersing myself in F1 races, anime, and video games.

### 💪🏽 Core Competencies
- Programming Languages: Python, C++, R, SQL, MATLAB
- Cloud & Developer Tools: Git, Docker, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery
- Libraries & Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Spark

**💻** I am actively seeking a full-time position as a Data Scientist where I can leverage my proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, and software development to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. Equipped with strong technical skills in Python, R, scikit-learn, and various deep learning frameworks, I am well-prepared to tackle challenging data problems. My passion lies in utilizing data to drive decision-making and address real-world problems.
